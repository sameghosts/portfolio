    //TODO: Fix Below
    proj_description: 'My very first individual development project. I had an extreme case of covid while making this and learned a lot about scope and being too ambitious for a first vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS application/game using the Canvas API. Due to the constraints of the project I could not use physics engines / animation environments like Matter.JS or P5 and instead built my own physics engine and collision physics. The project was able to reach MVP (firing pin, dead/zone space of the pinball table, working flippers), but did not have many of the aspects to make it a true "game." Despite this I put in an extreme amount of work and it really helped lay the foundation for my understanding of Javascript ES6 principles, variable scope and hoisting, classes and object oriented design. Despite being very buggy I am very proud of this project and can not wait to iterate on it when time becomes available. Ultimately a further iteration would implement the project in Typescript.',
